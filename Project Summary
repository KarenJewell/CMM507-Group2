Area: Plastic pollution composition
lead: Stuart
materials: Plastic Debris dataset
1. Good dataset on types of plastic: classed, counted and location
2. Concerns about data quality from manual logging, transposition and bias
3. Rubber appears to be logged in a single region only
4. UK long/lat data appears to be with errors - question about which long/lat system is used in logging
5. Some locations are land-locked (lakes, lochs, upriver) - question if these should be excluded if report scope is to do with Oceans.

1. strong relationship: Majority of generated waste is plastic waste
2. medium and low income countries are highest contributors to plastic waste
3. challenge: are medium and low income countries highest contributors because they are most densely populated? Opportunity to bring in population dataset
