Definition:
Relative quantities of floating micro- (<4.75mm) and macro- (>4.75mm) plastics in LMEs, based on a model of surface water circulation and the use of proxy inputs (shipping density, coastal population density, area of impermeable catchment i.e. urban areas with rapid run-off).

Unit: 
      Count density: counts/km2
      Weight Density: g/km2

Rationale for inclusion:
Plastic pollution is globally distributed across all oceans due to its properties of buoyancy and durability, and the sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment have led some researchers to claim that synthetic polymers in the ocean should be regarded as hazardous waste. However, there are rather few reliable observational data on the quantities of macro- and micro-plastics in most LMEs. This method provides an internally-consistent approach to indicating the relative importance of floating plastic in each LME.

Interlinkages with other transboundary water systems: 
The modelled distribution is a sub-set of the output at a global scale.

Measurement methods and calculation: 
Surface net tows and visual survey transects combined with a calibrated oceanographic model of floating debris.

Scale: Global grid at 0.2 nautical degree resolution.
