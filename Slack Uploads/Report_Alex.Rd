\section{Discussion}
It was noted that the main system for reporting debris was used by large scale clobes. This means that data is not a continuous and even flow so during events such as international beach cleanup day there may be more data in the respective month. Since these events aim mostly to cleanup after big social events extra effort might have been made to retrive entertainment based debris such as fireworks, food packaging and six pack rings.The decrease in cigarette waste was theorised to be in corelation with a decreasing smoking rate however the cigarette waste was not the direct focus of this paper so that avenue of inquiry was not followed.


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{cdsmote1}

Our hypothesis stands/does not stand.
The hypothesis H1 stands. This is no evidence as to a change in the percentage of marine debris being plastic in origin that can be observed in results such as in figure 4 which shows how the change in plastic quantity mirrors the change in overall debris quantity.  
Future work might involve continuing to study corelations similar to the fireworks/july corelation that was discussed in section 4.3. Another line of study might be for example to compare the decreasing rate of cigarette use with the decreasing observtion of cigarette debris which had been observed over the years to see if there is a corollation there which was hypothosised but never investigated due to not being the direct inquiry of the report.
